COMPILING FOR WINDOWS
---------------------

1. Install CMake.

2. Install Boost (see www.boost.org). At minimum, include the filesystem, system and serialization modules. Set an environment variable BOOST_ROOT to the Boost install location.

3. Install RDKit (see http://rdkit.org/), including the InChI Extensions (python extensions are not required). Set the environment variable RDBASE to the RDKit install location (the directory with Code, lib etc..)..

4. Download and unzip a development version of LPSolve (e.g. lp_solve_5.5.2.0_dev_win32.zip - see https://sourceforge.net/projects/lpsolve).

5. (optional) If you will be compiling the cfm-train and cfm-test executables, install a version of MPI, e.g. Mpich2.

6. Start the CMake GUI and set the source code location to the cfm directory (the directory with cfm-code, cfm-id...etc). Click Configure. A pop-up should appear asking you to select the generator. This code has been tested with VisualStudio 10 (using the free VisualStudio Express 2010 edition) so this is recommended. 

7. Update the LPSOLVE_INCLUDE_DIR to the root directory of LPSolve (i.e. where lp_lib.h is) and LPSOLVE_LIBRARY_DIR to the same directory (i.e. where liblpsolve55.dll is).

8. If you want to compile the cfm-train and cfm-test modules, click the INCLUDE_TRAIN and INCLUDE_TESTS checkboxes respectively. Otherwise make sure these are unchecked.

9. Once configration is complete, click Generate. This should generate the relevant project or makefiles. For Visual Studio, cfm.sln will be generated. Open this file in Visual Studio and build the INSTALL project. Any other generator, you're on your own!

10. This should produce the executable files in the cfm/bin directory.  Either add this directory to your path or start a command prompt in this directory. Run them from a command line as detailed on https://sourceforge.net/p/cfm-id/wiki/Home/.

COMPILING FOR LINUX 
--------------------

1. Install CMake (or check it's already there by running cmake at the command line).

2. Install Boost (see www.boost.org). At minimum, include the filesystem, system and serialization modules. Set an environment variable BOOST_ROOT to the Boost install location.

e.g:
Download boost_1_55_0.tar.gz from http://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_55_0.html
tar -zxvf boost_1_55_0.tar.gz 
cd boost_1_55_0
./bootstrap.sh --prefix=. --with-libraries=regex,serialization,filesystem,system
./b2 address-model=64 cflags=-fPIC cxxflags=-fPIC install
export BOOST_ROOT=~/boost_1_55_0

3. Install RDKit (see http://rdkit.org/), including the InChI Extensions (python extensions are not required). Set the environment variable RDBASE to the RDKit install location (the directory with Code, lib etc..).

e.g.
Download RDKit_2013_09_1.tgz from https://sourceforge.net/projects/rdkit/files/rdkit/Q3_2013/
tar -zxvf RDKit_2013_09_1.tgz
cd RDKit_2013_09_1/External/INCHI-API
bash download-inchi.sh
cd ../..
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DRDK_BUILD_INCHI_SUPPORT=ON -DBOOST_ROOT=~/boost_1_55_0
make install
export RDBASE=~/RDKit_2013_09_1

4. Download and compile the source code for LPSolve. Note: you may be able to use one of the pre-compiled dev versions (e.g.lp_solve_5.5.2.0_dev_ux64.tar.gz) but compiling from source is probably more reliable in terms of getting a correct match.

e.g.
Download lp_solve_5.5.2.0_source.tar.gz from https://sourceforge.net/projects/lpsolve/files/lpsolve/5.5.2.0
tar -zxvf lp_solve_5.5.2.0_source.tar.gz
cd lp_solve_5.5/lpsolve55
./ccc
(should create libs in e.g. lp_solve_5.5/lpsolve55/bin/ux64) 

5. (optional) If you will be compiling the cfm-train and cfm-test executables, install a version of MPI.

6. Download or check out the cfm code and create a new directory where you want the build files to appear and move to that directory.

e.g. 
svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/cfm-id/code/cfm cfm
mkdir build
cd build

7. Run cmake CFM_ROOT  where CFM_ROOT is the location of the cfm directory e.g. if you are in cfm/build, you can use cmake .. , setting the LPSOLVE_INCLUDE_DIR and LPSOLVE_LIBRARY_DIR values appropriately.

cmake .. -DLPSOLVE_INCLUDE_DIR=~/lp_solve_5.5 -DLPSOLVE_LIBRARY_DIR=~/lp_solve_5.5/lpsolve55/bin/ux64


8. (optional) If you will be compiling the cfm-train and cfm-test executables, use 

cmake -D INCLUDE_TESTS=ON -D INCLUDE_TRAIN=ON CFM_LOC

9. make install

10. This should produce the executable files in the cfm/bin directory.  Change to this directory.

11. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:RDBASE/lib:BOOST_ROOT/lib:LPSOLVE_LIBRARY_DIR

e.g.
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/boost_1_55_0/lib:~/RDKit_2013_09_1/lib:~/lp_solve_5.5/lpsolve55/bin/ux64

12. Run the programs from a command line as detailed on https://sourceforge.net/p/cfm-id/wiki/Home/
